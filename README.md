# C - Binary trees

Project about What is a binary tree, difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree, What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists, What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.

## Requirements :page_with_curl:

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## Task :heavy_check_mark:
This involves the files and prototypes.
